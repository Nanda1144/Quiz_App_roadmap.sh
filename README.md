# Quiz_App_roadmap.sh
In this project, we will be making a browser based quiz. The app will present users with a series of multiple-choice questions and after each question.

Requirements
As a developer, feel free to come up with a JSON based quiz the questions as you see fit.

The user will be initially presented with a “start” button and some detail about the quiz
When the user presses start they’re presented with the first multiple choice question.
The questions are to be presented as cards with the answers being buttons on the card.
When the user selects an answer, the answer buttons are to turn red or green depending on the result. It should also show what the correct answer was.
If the user answers correctly, a score is to be incremented.
At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with a final score and all of the results.
Optionally add a timer of 1 minute to each question, if user doesn’t attempt the question in that time, it should skip to next question and score should be decremented by 1.
